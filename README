-------------------------
Please post your ideas, discuss or report bugs at the forums at clawsoftware.de.This is a beta test. Please test the program on different pcs, different configurations, color settings, drivers etc and report back any crashes, bugs etc. Try out many different, especially unusual goal lists to test the core, let the program run some hours, change the settings, etc.
Please do not mess with the data files, the loading routines do not take notice of every error. In the worst case the programm will probably crash.

-------------------------
The program simulates an abstract StarCraft : Broodwar environment, calculates the time a certain build order needs and optimizes randomly created build orders to a given goal list using evolutionary algorithms.
Mouse commands:
- LEFT BUTTON: activates buttons and adds items
- RIGHT BUTTON: removes items (units) or adds very many items (+/- buttons)
While you can do everything with the mouse there are some Keyboard shortcuts:
- SPACE: deactivate drawing (less CPU usage / faster calculation)
- ALT + ENTER: switch between fullscreen and window mode
- ESC: quits the program without saving
- PAUSE: stop/continue calculation
Also the program produces an output:
- Saving/Loading: Saved build orders are placed in output/bos/<the race>/, goals are placed in settings/goals/<the race>/

There were no other libraries (except the C++ standard libraries) used.

* You may use Evolution Forge for Entertainment, Scientific Interest or Education purposes.
* You are allowed to make as many copies as you wish as long as you do not change any of the files (except all files in settings) and always distribute all files together.
* You may distribute any of the files in "settings" and "output" as you wish as long as you do not remove the link to www.clawsoftware.de or as long as you provide a link to www.clawsoftware.de yourself.

Also notice that the SDL.dll is patched. If you want to use a different SDL version make sure you have the latest patches availible. I did apply a patch and removed some MMX code of the source to allow MinGW to compile it.
