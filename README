-------------------------
Please post your ideas, discuss or report bugs at the forums at clawsoftware.de. 
This is a beta test. If you want to help finding bugs / increase the compatibility then please test the program on different pcs, different operating systems, different configurations, color settings, drivers etc. and (most important) report back any crashes, bugs etc you have encountered. Try out many different (especially unusual) goal lists to test the core, let the program run some hours, change the settings during a run etc.

Please do not mess with the data files, the loading routines do not take notice of every error. In the worst case the program might crash.
-------------------------

-------------------------
The program simulates an abstract StarCraft : Broodwar environment, calculates the time a certain build order needs and optimizes randomly created build orders to a given goal list using evolutionary algorithms which form a special tool to efficiently search through a large search space.

Mouse commands:
- LEFT BUTTON: activates buttons and adds items
- RIGHT BUTTON: removes items (units) or adds very many items (+/- buttons)

While you can do everything with the mouse there are some Keyboard shortcuts:
- PAUSE: stop optimizing
- SPACE: start / stop optimizing
- ALT + ENTER: switch between fullscreen and window mode
- CTRL + Q: quits the program
- ESC: quits the program without saving TODO
Also the program produces an output:


- Saving/Loading: Saved build orders are placed in output/bos/<the race>/, goals are placed in settings/goals/<the race>/

deactivate drawing (less CPU usage / faster calculation)

-------------------------
This is a BETA Version. That means that it is not fully tested and that there are one or more bugs that may cause any kind of damage (down to a nuclear meltdown if you are using it in a nuclear power plant). Though I tested it successfully on several different machines and in connection with different software configuration it is possible that the program or the whole system might crash and therefore data is lost or even worse. I SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS SOFTWARE. IN NO EVENT WILL I BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
