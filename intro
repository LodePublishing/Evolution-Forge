Welcome to Evolution Forge 1.60

This version is beta and probably still contains many bugs and several items are disabled or hidden as the code is not yet tested or written. Please report any crash, problem, bug or if you have ideas to the clawsoftware.de forums and sign the newsletter to receive news about any update of the software in the future.

I also encourage you to watch the free political videos and read the articles I am linking to on my homepage.

Thank you and have fun!

Regards,
