		Time a build order may use at maximum (has influence on the time the program needs to find a first solution)
		Shall a randomly created or a preprocessed build order used at the beginning?
		Maximum length of a build order
		How often shall the program restart to get an optimal build order?
		How many seconds may be between two orders?
		Is the program allowed to make some small adjustments on the goal list?
		What percentage of the next generation shall be created out of the best build order of this one?
		What percentage of the next generation shall be created by crossing over the genetic information of several programs of this generation?
# Radiobutton
		Minimum of graphics (all CPU power is allocated for the calculation) (for extreme minimalists: check the command line options)
		Set the graphics to nice :)
		Click yourself around
# Radiobutton + Eingabefeld
		The higher this setting the more CPU power is needed and the faster is the program
		Shall the program (as far as possible) hold a constant framerate?
		How often shall the screen be updated between two generations?
# an, aus
		Shall the objects move around slowly or shall they directly jump to their destinations?
		Transparent objects (needs some CPU :) )
